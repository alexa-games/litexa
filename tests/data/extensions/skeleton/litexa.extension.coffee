# This file documents the extension module format

# An extension module should export this single function, returning
# an object with some or all of the given keys below.
# The options argument is the value of the key with the same name
# as this module, in the user project's litexa.config.js/ts/json/coffee
# project configuration file.
# The lib argument is the same lib object passed down to the
# parser, and contains most of the objects used to construct
# a Litexa skill, including those added by other extensions.

module.exports = (options, lib) ->
  return
    # new language features, modifying the compiler
    language: languageStuff

    # adding new features to the compilation process
    compiler: compilerStuff

    # new asset pipeline features, supporting more asset types
    assetPipeline: assetPipelineStuff

    # runtime features, adding code to the handler directly
    runtime: runtimeStuff


# The language key in the exports defines additions to the parser
# and resulting skill object tree.
languageStuff =
  # an entry point to add new general runtime statements to
  # the Litexa language
  statements:

    # the key here is the top level rule name to insert into
    # the list of statements, and the value is the pegjs code
    # necessary to recognize the new statement, which can

# Either of the runtime strategies are required to produce a
# function that at runtime will be invoked to produce an object
# The function will be called from inside the concurrency wrapper,
# after the request has been parsed, but before the statemachine

# variable scope state, the database interface, etc.

  # insert pre statemachine code here, e.g. cache invalidator,
  # mandatory prefetches, etc. Please make a best effort to keep
  # this function as light as possible, as it WILL be run for EVERY
  # request sent to the skill.

  # if you're going to store any permanent data in the database,
  # please add only a single key, named the same as your API, prefixed
  # with a single underscore.
  # Note: the database backing is a replicated by-reference object
  # store, so any changes you make to the object will automatically
  # be persisted at the end of the request handler
  # reminder: you can only store JSON compatible data here
