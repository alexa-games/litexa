# litexa-syntax-highlighting

This Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension supports syntax highlighting for files written in the Litexa language for
Alexa skills. Any such files will be denoted with the `.litexa` file extension.

## Installation

You can find and install the extension in the VS Code Extensions Marketplace, by the name `Litexa Syntax Highlighting`.

Alternatively, you can either copy or symlink the `litexa-vscode/litexa` directory to your
[VS Code extensions directory](#vs-code-extensions-directory) and relaunch VS Code.

### VS Code Extensions Directory

Extensions are installed in a per-user extensions directory. Depending on your platform, the directory is located here:

* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
* macOS: `~/.vscode/extensions`
* Linux: `~/.vscode/extensions`

You can change the location by launching VS Code with the `--extensions-dir <dir>` command line option.
